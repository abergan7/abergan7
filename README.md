# Hey there 👋, fellow GitHub voyagers!

- Welcome aboard my frontend spaceship, where we navigate the cosmic chaos of pixels and polygons with the grace of a drunken astronaut in zero gravity! 🌌✨
- I'm Andraž Bergant, your trusty co-pilot in this epic journey through the tangled jungles of JavaScript and the whimsical wonders of HTML and CSS. 🛸
- When I'm not lost in the nebula of nested divs or deciphering the mysteries of TypeScript, you might catch me chasing my tail... I mean, debugging code with my loyal sidekick (hint: he's got four legs and a wagging tail). 🐶💻
